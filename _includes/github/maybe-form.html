  <p>Hello Jamie.</p>
  <p>
  My name is <input type="text" name="name" id="name" class="medium" /> from GitHub.
  It's too early to tell if this will work. Let's talk further to see if we are compatable.
  My email address is <input type="text" name="email" id="email" class="large" /> but if you'd rather call me, then 
  my number is <input type="text" name="phone" id="phone" class="medium" placeholder="(just email me)" />
  </p>
  <p>
  I have some questions for you to get to know you a little more:
  <br />
  <textarea name="message" id="message"></textarea>
  </p>
  I have some initial feelings for you but I am not sure about our future.
  <br />
  <input type="hidden" name="subject" id="subject" value="Inquiry from GitHub (MAYBE)" />
  <input type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" value="So you're telling him there is a chance" />
</form>
