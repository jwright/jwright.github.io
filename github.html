          <div class="section">
            <h3>Professional nerd</h3>
            <div class="reason">
              I love programming. Most of my waking hours are spent crafting code in a Vim terminal on my MacBook Pro. I love <a href="http://githubfantasy.com">creating things</a> and my adrenaline goes nuts when I get to ship.  My language of choice is Ruby and my framework of choice is Rails. Lately I have been playing around with Ember and Sinatra and I have been really enjoying it. I also enjoy RubyMotion and iOS development.
            </div>

            <h3>I'm a business, man</h3>
            <div class="reason">
              I have run two companies in the past seven years. I started <a href="http://brilliantfantastic.com">Brilliant Fantastic</a> in 2006 where I was an independent consultant. I released <a href="http://teammorale.com">Morale</a> as my first product in 2009. Last year I hired <a href="http://twitter.com/keiththomps">Keith Thompson</a> to work with me and we released our <a href="http://brilliantfantastic.com/training">Ruby on Rails training</a> earlier this year. 
              <br />
              In 2011 I started <a href="http://seedcoworking.com">Seed Coworking</a> with two other partners. I got sick of talking to myself in my basement.
              <br />
              I have grown to hate consulting for numerous reasons which I would love to talk about. I want to build product.
            </div>

            <h3>I :heart: speaking</h3>
            <div class="reason">
              I have been spreading the propaganda created from my experiences for several years now. I have a soft spot for education and speaking helps me help others. I have had the privledge for speaking at regional conferences like <a href="http://codemash.org">Codemash</a>, <a href="http://www.codepalousa.com/">Code PaLOUsa</a>, and <a href="http://devlink.net/">devLink</a>. I was able to create <a href="http://githubfantasy.com">GitHub Fantasy League</a> from my Codemash talk.
            </div>

            <h3>When I have a moment</h3>
            <div class="reason">
              When I am not programming (like I said, most waking hours), I have my hands full with my family which consists of a beautiful wife, 2 1/2 girls, and a small (male !!) dog. I love to travel and I would rather code in a strange place than at home. I bike during the summer and I still <a href="https://twitter.com/jwright/status/333678843007229952/photo/1">play paintball</a> when I can. I used to play <a href="http://pspevents.com/">professionally</a> and I am looking to get back into it competitively.

          <div class="section">
            <h3>You're a meritocracy</h3>
            <div class="reason">
              The way that you work, <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/adopt-an-open-source-process-constraints">like an open source project</a>, is amazing to me. It just fits me. I love how GitHub solves a multitude of problems by <a href="https://github.com/play/play">building applications</a>. I love how you <a href="https://github.com/blog/1242-octokittens-everywhere">support family</a>. I love how you <a href="https://github.com/blog/category/drinkup">support the community</a>. I love drink ups (<a href="https://twitter.com/jwright/status/381473458720628736">except for the day after</a>). The GitHub culture was created for people like me.
            </div>

            <h3>Your family is the best</h3>
            <div class="reason">
              The amount of talent and love that flows through GitHub is mind boggling to me. I am so impressed by the people and <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot">projects</a> that come out of GitHub. I know I can add value to that. I know I can teach and I know I can be taught. I work very well with teams and I had to do so in many different capacities with Brilliant Fantastic.
            </div>

            <h3>Your products are amazing</h3>
            <div class="reason">
              I <a href="https://twitter.com/jwright/status/319171361081815040/photo/1">use GitHub.com every single day</a>. There are areas like reviewing pull requests and the activity stream that I have some ideas around. I have a passion for making enterprise software better. I love making developer tools that make teams work and play better together. I want to make SpeakerDeck even more badass than it is. I even have some ideas on new products that would fit inside the GitHub ecosystem perfectly. I'd love to discuss these with you.
            </div>

            <h3>Let's consider going steady</h3>
            <div class="reason">
              I have thought about wanting to reach out to you for quite some time. I did not take this decision lightly. I wanted to make sure that I would bring value to GitHub and I wanted to make sure GitHub would be a place I wanted to be. To be honest, I didn't think I could 'be employed' anywhere. I have tried. However, the culture at GitHub fits me so well. It is the only place I think I can be. It is the only place I want to be.

            <p>Hello Jamie.</p>
            <p>
            My name is <input type="text" name="name" id="name" class="medium" /> from GitHub.
            I think we would perhaps make a good couple. I would love to chat.
            My email address is <input type="text" name="email" id="email" class="large" /> but if you'd rather call me, then 
            my number is <input type="text" name="phone" id="phone" class="medium" placeholder="(just email me)" />
            </p>
            <p>
            I will start the conversation between us with the following message:
            <br />
            <textarea name="message" id="message"></textarea>
            </p>
            I hope this works out.

            My name is <input type="text" name="name" id="name" class="medium" /> from GitHub.
            We are already seeing someone right now. I wish we could of made this work.
            If you'd like to talk, my email address is <input type="text" name="email" id="email" class="large" /> but if you'd rather call me, then

            <p>Hello Jamie.</p>
            <p>
            My name is <input type="text" name="name" id="name" class="medium" /> from GitHub.
            It's too early to tell if this will work. Let's talk further to see if we are compatable.
            My email address is <input type="text" name="email" id="email" class="large" /> but if you'd rather call me, then 
            my number is <input type="text" name="phone" id="phone" class="medium" placeholder="(just email me)" />
            </p>
            <p>
            I have some questions for you to get to know you a little more:
            <br />
            <textarea name="message" id="message"></textarea>
            </p>
            I have some initial feelings for you but I am not sure about our future.
